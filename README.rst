genDevConfig 3.x - Generate a Shinken host and service config for an networked device using SNMP.

For the given device, generate a Shinken configuration directory. Within this
directory it will place a "deviname" file which will contain the following 
logical information:

define host {
     host_name    ...
     ...
}
define service {
     chassis_target
}
     ...
     custom_target1
     ...
     custom_targetN

     interface_target1
     ...
     interface_targetN

The INSTALL file has all the installation and setup information necessary to use the tool.

`Shinken`__ host and service configurations generated by genDevConfig are meant to be used with `SnmpBooster`__, the Shinken SNMP poller module.

Learn more about the installation and use of `SnmpBooster in the Shinken wiki`__.
