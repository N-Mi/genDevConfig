============================
Presentation of genDevConfig
============================

genDevConfig is a perl Script that will generate the configuration to supervise a networked device using SNMP. 
The configuration that is generated is meant to be used with the Shinken monitoring system.

genDevConfig includes plugins to identify various hosts and RFC compliant interface types. 
Each plugin is a perl script that is imported at runtime by genDevConfig.

============
Installation
============

The INSTALL file has all the installation and setup information necessary to use the tool.

===============
Expected output
===============

For the given device, genDevConfig will generate a Shinken configuration directory. Within this
directory it will place a file, named after the "device host_name", which will contain the following 
information:

define host {
     host_name    ...
     ...
}

define service {
     chassis_service
}
     ...
     custom_service1
     ...
     custom_serviceN

     interface_service1
     ...
     interface_serviceN

=====================================
Shinken monitoring system integration
=====================================

`Shinken`__ host and service configurations generated by genDevConfig are meant to be used with `SnmpBooster`__, the Shinken SNMP poller module.
